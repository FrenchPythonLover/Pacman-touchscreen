# Touchscreen Pacman
Welcome to the repository about a **touchscreen compatible *pacman* game written in python** !<br>
## Requirements
The game's requires having python librairy **pygame**, and , of course, python version **3** installed ! <br>
By the courtesy of _FrenchPythonLover_, both installation scripts for **Windows** and **Linux** have been added !
## How do i play ?
First of all, go on download the `Pacman-TouchScreen.zip` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Tilto66/Pacman-touchscreen/releases/latest), and extreact it anywhere in your computer, then follow for your OS.<br>
## Linux
### Debian, Ubuntu and other debian based distros that use the apt package manager
Execute the `installers/linux/debianinstall` script, then simply run `python3 ./main.py`, and enjoy !
### Other distros
Execute the `installers/linux/genericinstall`Â script, then simply run `installer/linux/genericplay`<br>
*Note: You'll still have to execute the `genericplay` script everytime you want to play*
## Windows
Double click on the `installers\windows.bat`, and run `.\play.bat` (or run in command prompt `py .\main.py`)

## Note to devs
This program is commented in french, but a simple translator like [**Google Translate**](https://translate.google.fr/?hl=fr&sl=fr&tl=en&op=translate) should help !
